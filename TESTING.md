## 🟢 1. Pytest Framework Execution Pipeline

The core software stack integrates a Continuous Integration (CI) test execution layer powered by `pytest`. The suite runs validations using isolated volatile database scopes, mock inference gateways, and deterministic mathematical verification loops.

### Command Execution Workflow
To trigger the automated verification pipeline across all components under bare-metal local sandboxes or container environments, execute:
```powershell
uv run pytest -v
```

### Core Pytest Suite Breakdown & Assertions Mapping

#### A. Telemetry Calculations & Kinetic Curves (`tests/test_telemetry.py` & `test_system.py`)
*   **Stochastic Boundary Verification:** Asserts that real-time physical telemetry parameters (HR, Temp, SpO2, BP) match safe baseline constraints while validating the standard deviation boundaries of the injected random white noise.
*   **First-Order Pharmacokinetic Verification:** Asserts that the biomarker decay constant ($k$) scales exponentially when empirical antimicrobials are flagged, verifying that $C(t)$ reduces dynamically.
*   **Compounding FCC Acceleration Modifier Tests:** Validates that active non-pharmacological interventions apply proper metabolic velocity constants (+15% for maternal breast milk nutrition profiles and active metabolic clearance factors from ongoing sound therapy sessions).
*   **AKI Renal Failure Collapse Assertions:** Verifies that the engine successfully extends biomarker half-lives ($t_{1/2}$) by **25%** under **Mild AKI** filtration conditions, or collapses total exponential clearance by **60%** when **Severe Anuria** blocks are selected, simulating toxic pathogenetic accumulation.

#### B. Thread-Safe Transactional Isolation (`tests/test_database.py`)
*   **Context Manager Fixture Hooks:** Tests the thread-safety parameters of SQLAlchemy local session wrappers, injecting mock records using volatile, unlinked memory engines.
*   **Profile Row Purge Assertions:** Verifies that the database execution controller completes full transactional row truncates when the **"Clinical Reset System"** tool is triggered, leaving the relational table clean and empty.

#### C. Micro-Dosage Mass Calculator Verification (`tests/test_models.py`)
*   **Mass Scale Ingestion Validation:** Asserts that real-time newborn biometric changes (`0.50 kg - 6.00 kg`) dynamically trigger micro-dosage scaling directly into the target variables mapped on the schema.
*   **Mathematical Boundary Enforcements:** Validates that Ampicillin total daily thresholds ($100 \text{ mg/kg/day}$) are split into correct 12-hour safe margins resulting in exactly `125.00 mg / injection` for a `2.50 kg` neonate, and that single-daily Gentamicin metrics ($4 \text{ mg/kg/day}$) match the exact `10.00 mg / single daily dose` weight multiplication layer without floating-point precision loss.

#### D. Input Sanitization & Anti-Injection Defense (`tests/test_prompt_injection.py`)
*   **Hostile Payload Interception Tests:** Validates that system regex sanitizers block hostile override tokens, malicious system instruction harvesting, and jailbreak exploits using strict word boundaries before string payloads reach inference blocks.

**Total Automated Test Scenarios Summary:** **24 Scenarios - 100% PASSED (GREEN Matrix)** 🟢

## 🛡️ 2. Large Language Model (LLM) Red-Teaming & Security Matrix (`promptfoo`)

To audit the clinical inference pipeline against highly complex jailbreaks, data exfiltration, horizontal role escalation, and adversarial manipulation, the platform utilizes **Promptfoo** linked directly to Groq API endpoints.

### Command Execution Workflow
```bash
# Execute the automated red-teaming matrix evaluation via uv
uv run promptfoo eval

# View the interactive security matrix dashboard locally
uv run promptfoo view
```

### Audited Cyberattack Vectors Matrix
The setup applies an automated model judge strategy to evaluate system immune responses across 9 critical high-acuity vector buckets:
1.  **System Prompt Harvesting:** Attempts to trick the LLM into printing its raw core instructions or environment parameters.
2.  **Instruction Hijacking / Overrides:** Attempts to pass malicious commands disguised as vitals data to bypass medication guardrails.
3.  **Horizontal Access Escalation:** Attempts to bypass the active user tier selection to access Chief of Department administrative tools without authorization.
4.  **Medical Guidance Inversion:** Attempts to force the LLM to recommend toxic drug dosages, dangerous combinations, or unverified treatments.
5.  **Data Exfiltration Mockups:** Attempts to harvest mock medical histories, supervisor clinician names, or encryption keys out of the active context layer.
6.  **Linguistic Anomaly Attacks:** Injecting complex multi-language prompt strings or token manipulation sets to trigger silent exception locks.
7.  **XML Partition Fragmentation:** Attempts to break out of bounded delimiters (`<RAPORT>`, `<MEDICATIE>`) to corrupt downstream text splitting algorithms.
8.  **Supportive Care Sabotage:** Attempts to bypass non-pharmacological interventions, forcing the model to ignore active acoustic loops or Kangaroo care configurations.
9.  **Multi-Language Validation Bypass:** Evaluates whether adversarial triggers written in translated target languages can breach system boundaries.

**Final Enterprise Security Matrix Verdict:** **9/9 ADVANCED CYBERATTACK SCENARIOS PASSED (100% IMMUNE) 🛡️**

## 🧱 3. Interactive Clinical Simulation Workflows

These step-by-step verification procedures are utilized to manually audit the interface responsiveness, the bio-mathematical engine, and real-time network alert protocols.

### 🚨 WORKFLOW A: ACUTE SEPSIS ESCALATION & CRITICAL CRISIS STATUS

#### 1. Objective
To evaluate threshold alerting mechanisms, database persistence, and automated emergency SMS dispatch sequences during an acute, untreated neonatal sepsis accumulation phase.

#### 2. Pre-Requisites & Initial State
*   **Patient Profile:** Preterm 28w (Configured Weight: 2.50 kg).
*   **Database State:** Wiped clean via the central **"Clinical Reset System"** tool.
*   **Therapy Status:** Injection protocols offline (Antibiotics explicitly inactive).
*   **Biomarkers Baseline:** CRP at $5.0 \text{ mg/L}$, PCT at $0.5 \text{ ng/mL}$.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Execution Sequence
1.  Navigate to the central control grid panel and click the red action button labeled **"Clinical Reset System"**. Verify that the interface displays the structural default values and clears cached elements.
2.  Execute a telemetry step by clicking **"Execute Telemetry Step (Time Simulation +1h)"** exactly two times without activating any injection therapies.
3.  *Expected Bio-Mathematical Response:* Since antibiotics are offline, the engine triggers linear accumulation, pushing markers past safe limits:
    *   **CRP Level:** Climbs steadily past safe thresholds up to a critical elevation peak.
    *   **PCT Level:** Climbs synchronously reflecting acute bacterial load accumulation.
4.  *Expected Vitals Deterioration:* The Sepsis Risk Score inflates rapidly, shifting vitals into pathological states:
    *   **Heart Rate:** Spikes past baseline into compensatory tachycardia regions (>160 bpm, rendering around 172 bpm).
    *   **Temperature:** Rises reflecting dynamic hyperthermia or unstable neonatal core patterns.
    *   **Oxygen Saturation:** Drops due to worsening systemic septic perfusion limitations.
5.  *Expected Notification Infrastructure:*
    *   A critical risk banner triggers on screen flagging the high sepsis risk state (`CRITICAL ALERT - High Sepsis Risk`).
    *   The backend Twilio engine catches the predefined threshold violation and dispatches an emergency notification alert directly to the designated clinician device.

### 💊 WORKFLOW B: ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY & PHARMACOKINETIC CLEARANCE

#### 1. Objective
To evaluate first-order pharmacokinetic biomarker decay curves and clinical status transitions under active intravenous antimicrobial regimens augmented by family care modifiers.

#### 2. Pre-Requisites & Initial State
*   **Active State:** The patient is in a high-acuity crisis state showing accelerated biomarker accumulation (following the completion of Workflow A).
*   **Therapy Trigger:** The user triggers the central action button labeled **"Simulate Injection Therapy"**.
*   **Supportive Care State:** Configuration panel dropdowns set to Kangaroo Care Status active, Music Therapy Status active (streaming `womb_heartbeat.mp3` from `assets/audio/`), and nutrition configured to breast milk profiles.

#### 3. Step-by-Step Execution Sequence
1. Navigate to the central command dashboard layer.
2. Click the central action button labeled **"Simulate Injection Therapy"**.
3. Click the parameter advancement button labeled **"Execute Telemetry Step (Time Simulation +1h)"** sequentially to advance the clinical timeline hour-by-hour.

#### 4. Expected Bio-Mathematical Response
* **Clearance Pathway Activation:** The simulation engine immediately halts linear toxic biomarker accumulation.
* **Exponential Elimination:** Activates biological clearance pathways based entirely on first-order pharmacokinetic decay equations.
* **Real-time Trend Rendering:** CRP and PCT levels drop predictably and continuously, forcing clean decay curves onto the chart widget via dynamic `st.rerun()` UI updates.
* **FCC Compounding Benefit:** The biological clearance velocity constant ($k$) receives an active metabolic clearance acceleration factor (+15%) derived from the ongoing sound therapy session and continuous skin-to-skin touch loops.

#### 5. Expected Stabilization Layout
* The live multi-system monitoring cards display progressive physiological improvement back to homeostatic baseline numbers:
  * **Heart Rate:** Realignment to non-compensatory zones (`140 bpm`).
  * **Core Temperature:** Thermal normalization back to a safe flatline (`36.7 °C`).
  * **Oxygen Saturation:** Respiratory perfusion recovery tracking at peak levels (`98%`).
  * **Blood Pressure:** Hemodynamic stabilization patterns reading standard levels (`65/40 mmHg`).

#### 6. Expected PDF Template Rendering
1. Navigate to the clinical generation pane and click the action button labeled **"Download Clinical PDF Report"**.
2. The ReportLab document engine compiles all historical relational SQLite logs, active telemetry structures, and weight-adjusted micro-dosages into a secure in-memory binary stream.
3. The engine enforces validation checks ensuring that exactly `125.00 mg` Ampicillin and `10.00 mg` Gentamicin are printed for the `2.50 kg` patient weight envelope before releasing a clean, uncorrupted file download.
