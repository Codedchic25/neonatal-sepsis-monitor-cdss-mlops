---

### 46. What is Alembic?

**Answer**

Alembic is a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy that tracks and applies schema changes over time.

---

### 47. Why are migrations important?

**Answer**

Migrations ensure that database structures remain consistent across environments and deployments.

---

### 48. What problem did you solve with the reconstructed migration?

**Answer**

The original Alembic revision was missing. I recreated the baseline migration so Alembic could properly track the schema version and maintain migration integrity.

---

### 49. What is schema versioning?

**Answer**

Schema versioning tracks database changes over time and ensures reproducible deployments.

---

### 50. How would you migrate to production?

**Answer**

I would switch the connection string to PostgreSQL, apply Alembic migrations, configure environment variables, and deploy the application through Docker or cloud infrastructure.

---

## Section 10 – Testing & Quality Assurance

**Answer**

It verifies multilingual consistency, sepsis classification, AKI handling, prompt injection resistance, and stable patient evaluation.

---

### 80. Why is AI evaluation important in healthcare?

**Answer**

Healthcare systems require a higher level of reliability, transparency, and safety than general-purpose applications.

---

## Section 13 – CI/CD, Docker & Production Readiness

### 81. What is CI/CD?

**Answer**

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates testing, validation, and deployment processes to improve software quality and delivery speed.

---

### 82. How is CI implemented in your project?

**Answer**

The project uses GitHub Actions to automatically execute code quality checks, Pytest test suites, Promptfoo evaluations, and Docker build validation whenever code is pushed or a pull request is created.

**Answer**

The Docker validation job verifies that the application can be successfully packaged into a runnable container image.

---

### 89. What would be required for production deployment?

**Answer**

A production deployment would require PostgreSQL, secure secret management, monitoring, backup strategies, logging, and cloud infrastructure configuration.

---

### 90. How would you scale the application?

**Answer**

I would separate the frontend, API services, AI services, and database components while deploying them using containers and managed cloud services.

---

## Section 14 – Senior Engineer Questions

### 91. Why did you choose rule-based thresholds instead of a machine learning classifier?

**Answer**

For this project, explainability and deterministic behavior were priorities. Clinical thresholds provide transparent and auditable decision logic suitable for educational decision-support workflows.

---

### 92. What are the limitations of the current system?

**Answer**

The system is an educational clinical decision-support platform and does not perform real-time hospital integration, live EHR connectivity, or clinically validated diagnostic predictions.

---

### 93. What would you improve if given six more months?

**Answer**

I would implement FastAPI services, PostgreSQL deployment, authentication, audit logging, monitoring dashboards, and advanced ML-based risk prediction models.

---

### 94. Why not use FastAPI instead of Streamlit?

**Answer**

Streamlit allowed rapid prototyping of the complete workflow. In a production environment, I would likely separate the backend into FastAPI services while keeping a dedicated frontend interface.

---

### 95. Why is explainability important in healthcare AI?

**Answer**

Healthcare professionals must understand how recommendations are generated. Explainability improves trust, transparency, and clinical accountability.
