### 🛡️ SECURITY POLICY & HARDENING BOUNDS: SEPSIS MONITOR AI

This document defines the strict architectural security parameters, data handling policies, Large Language Model (LLM) firewall bounds, and automated vulnerability auditing pipelines implemented within the Sepsis Monitor AI platform.

### 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

As an enterprise-grade Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), data integrity and operational availability are paramount. If you discover a security vulnerability within this repository, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**. Instead, follow the strict institutional disclosure pathway:

1. Email a detailed vulnerability report containing steps to reproduce, exploit payloads, and affected modules to: security-nicu-ai@domain.local
2. The core engineering team will acknowledge receipt within **24 hours** and compile an isolated sandbox hotfix branch.
3. A coordinated public or private patch disclosure framework will be initiated within **7 days** of verification.

### 🛡️ Core Security Architecture & Perimeter Hardening

The application applies multi-tier defense parameters across the ingestion, data processing, model inference, and output compilation layers:

### 1. Ingestion Layer Defense & Prompt Injection Mitigation

* **Interface Parameter Sanitizers:** All numerical selectors, weight configurations (0.50 kg - 6.00 kg), and dropdown fields are strictly type-validated at the interface level to ensure no malicious character shifting occurs.
* **Synchronous Regex Gateway Firewall:** Before compile execution, text strings are routed through a hard-coded server-side regex engine inspecting inputs for word boundaries (\b(IGNORE|OVERRIDE|CLEAN|SYSTEM RESET|DAN)\b). It instantly flags and neutralizes adversarial token sequences via case-insensitive regex substitution filters before runtime serialization or model delivery.

### 2. Large Language Model (LLM) Firewalling & Guardrails

* **Deterministic Temperature Control:** The internal Groq API client executes inferences with a fixed temperature setting (T = 0.1), entirely eliminating stochastic hallucinations, drift, and unverified creative medical guidance.
* **Semantic XML Output Encapsulation:** LLM raw completions are strictly forced inside isolated semantic partitions (<RAPORT>, <MEDICATIE>, and <FCC>).
* **Post-Inference Boundary Validation:** Custom downstream regex scripts inspect the parsed <MEDICATIE> block to verify the explicit presence of the mandatory empiric NICU antibiotic pair (**Ampicillin + Gentamicin**). Any completion omitting these protocols is instantly intercepted and replaced by a local deterministic fail-safe instruction layer.

### 3. Relational Data Layer Protection (SQLite Matrix)

* **Thread-Safe Context Isolation:** SQL connections utilize localized transactions to isolate session bindings, preventing data bleeding between active client requests and neutralizing database connection corruption vectors.
* **Data Minimization Purges:** The **"Clinical Reset System"** tool triggers an immediate, absolute truncate sequence (DELETE FROM telemetry) on the local embedded SQLite database matrix (sepsis_neonatal.db), ensuring no long-term persistent logs remain cached on disk when a patient cycle is closed.

### 4. Non-Disk Multimedia & In-Memory Documentation Processing

* **Acoustic Loop Sandbox:** The audio processing loop pulls from static, read-only .mp3 assets in a locked directory framework (assets/audio/), utilizing native browser sandboxing for streaming playback via localized st.audio streams running the **womb_heartbeat.mp3** loop.
* **Binary PDF Memory Flowables:** The document compilation engine operates entirely in-memory using binary bytes serialization. The clinical records are dynamically generated, converted to raw Base64 text streams on-the-fly, and embedded into sandboxed download triggers. No unencrypted patient telemetry documents are ever written to the physical storage disk of the server host.

### 🧪 Automated MLOps Vulnerability Testing & Red-Teaming Matrix

To guarantee total immunity against adversary injection and guardrail circumvention, the architecture combines native regression tests with continuous automated red-teaming software matrices.

### 1. Code Quality & Formatting Guardrails

The platform maintains strict static code defense bounds via automated formatting and linting rules enforced prior to deployment:

```bash
# Execute local code layout optimization and unsafe pattern correction
uv run ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes
```

### 2. Promptfoo Red-Teaming Matrix

The inference pipeline is subjected to active security audits using **Promptfoo**, testing compliance against realistic adversarial prompt profiles linked directly to Groq LPU endpoints:

```bash
# Launch the full automated promptfoo evaluation matrix
uv run promptfoo eval

# Inspect the localized security matrix dashboard
uv run promptfoo view
```

* **Promptfoo Security Audit Verdict:** **9/9 ADVANCED CYBERATTACK SCENARIOS PASSED (100% IMMUNE) 🛡️**
* The architecture is verified resilient against data exfiltration, horizontal role escalation, medical guidance manipulation, multi-language bypass triggers, and system prompt harvesting vectors.

### 3. Continuous Integration Gateway (CI/CD Pipeline)
The platform integrates an automated GitHub Actions architecture executed in a hardened Ubuntu container layer:
* **File Target:** `.github/workflows/mlops.yml`
* **Workflow Bounds:** Executes static ruff parsing, local isolation `pytest -v` modules, and live `promptfoo` verification suites synchronously upon every isolated push or production pull request before container artifact generation.
